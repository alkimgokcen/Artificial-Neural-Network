# Artificial-Neural-Network on MATLAB
A feedforward multi-layer perceptron Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model trained by Levenberg-Marquardt optimization method.

=> See "example_code.m" for example use.

=> Newton and GoldenSection methods are adopted to optimize learning rate (Adjust commenting in "ffnnetwork.m").

=> Update hout/houtprime functions as tansig(x)/1-tansig^2(x) for classification.

=> update h/hprime function to change activation functions.
